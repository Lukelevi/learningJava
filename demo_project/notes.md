# Map #
 - a place to store `key-value pairs`

# LinkedHashMap 
-like HashMap, but keeps entries in the order you added them `(insertion order)`

# In Java, all code must live inside a class.

# Method Signature (functions in Python)
- public static `Map<String, Integer> change(int amountDue, int amountPaid)` {}

# static 
- `Can be called witout creating an object`

# Create an empty dictionary;
- `Map<String, Integer> register = new LinkedHashMap<>();`
- Kepps `keys` in order so e always start with the largest denomination.

# HashMap
- A normal `HashMap` does not guarantee order, so when you print it, entries appear in random order.
